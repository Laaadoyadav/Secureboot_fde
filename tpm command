Importing a key created using OpenSSL into a TPM 2.0 involves several steps, primarily due to differences in how keys are handled and stored between software-based (like OpenSSL) and hardware-based (TPM 2.0) cryptographic modules. Here’s a general approach to achieve this:
1. Generate a Key Pair with OpenSSL

First, you need to generate a key pair (private key and corresponding public key) using OpenSSL:

bash

# Generate a private key (for example, RSA 2048-bit key)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -aes256
# Extract the public key from the private key
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

2. Convert the Private Key to TPM Format (TPM2B_PRIVATE)

TPM 2.0 requires keys to be in a specific format (TPM2B_PRIVATE). OpenSSL generates keys in PEM or DER format, so you need a tool to convert them. A commonly used tool is tpm2-tools.

bash

# Convert the OpenSSL private key to TPM2B_PRIVATE format
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -outform DER -out private_key.der

3. Install Necessary Tools

Ensure you have tpm2-tools installed. This package includes commands to interact with TPM 2.0.

bash

sudo apt-get install tpm2-tools

4. Import the Key into TPM 2.0

Use tpm2-tools to import the key into the TPM:

bash

# Load the private key into the TPM
tpm2_load -C o -u public_key.pem -r private_key.der -c imported_key.ctx

5. Use the Imported Key

Once imported, you can use the key for cryptographic operations supported by the TPM. This typically involves using tpm2_sign or similar commands.
Notes:

    Key Conversion: The conversion step (openssl rsa) is crucial as it prepares the private key for TPM import.
    Tool Dependencies: Ensure tpm2-tools is correctly installed and configured on your system.
    TPM Capabilities: TPM 2.0 supports various cryptographic algorithms; ensure your OpenSSL-generated key aligns with TPM-supported algorithms (RSA, ECC, etc.).

By following these steps, you can successfully import a key created using OpenSSL into a TPM 2.0 for secure cryptographic operations.
what about reading the key or exporting

Exporting a key from a TPM 2.0 and reading it for use outside of the TPM involves a slightly different process compared to importing a key into the TPM. Here’s how you can achieve this:
Exporting a Key from TPM 2.0

To export a key from a TPM 2.0, you typically need to follow these steps:

    Load the Key into TPM: If the key is already loaded into the TPM, you'll need its handle (key_handle) to export it.

    Use tpm2-tools to Export the Key:

    bash

    tpm2_evictcontrol -C o -c key_handle -o exported_key.dat

        Replace key_handle with the actual handle of the key you want to export.
        exported_key.dat is the file where the key will be saved.

Reading the Exported Key

Once the key is exported from the TPM, you can read it using OpenSSL or another tool capable of handling the key format.
Example with OpenSSL (Assuming it's an RSA key):

bash

openssl rsa -inform DER -in exported_key.dat -out exported_key.pem

    exported_key.dat is the file containing the exported key in DER format.
    exported_key.pem will be the output file containing the key in PEM format.

Notes:

    Key Handle: When exporting a key from TPM, you need to specify the key handle (-c key_handle). This handle uniquely identifies the key within the TPM.

    Key Format: TPM typically exports keys in a binary format (DER or other TPM-specific format). You may need to convert it to a format suitable for use outside the TPM (e.g., PEM for OpenSSL).

    Security Considerations: Ensure proper security measures when handling and storing exported keys, as they contain sensitive cryptographic material.

By following these steps, you can export a key from TPM 2.0 and then read it using OpenSSL or another appropriate tool for further use or backup purposes.
